    <glossdef>
        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>BIRTHPOSITION is an optional sub-element
                located within <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="biography">BIOGRAPHY</term></uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="birth">BIRTH</term></uicontrol>
                </menucascade>. It captures information about a writer's position within her family.
                In systematically capturing information about BIRTHPOSITION, we are providing
                material for investigating its influence, especially in relation to gender position.
                It has values <userinput>Eldest</userinput>, <userinput>Youngest</userinput>, or
                    <userinput>Only</userinput>. Choice of attribute value may be a judgement call
                in face of blended families or siblings dying very young. Bear in mind the way this
                attribute value reflects conditions of a writerâ€™s childhood. Such statements as "She
                was the middle one of five daughters" may be included in the <term
                    keyref="chron-prose">CHRONPROSE</term> recording her birth or may be placed in a
                    <term keyref="short-prose">SHORT-PROSE</term> element following the <term
                    keyref="chron-struct">CHRONSTRUCT</term>.</p></div>
        <div>
            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock>&lt;BIRTH&gt;&lt;CHRONSTRUCT&gt;&lt;DATE&gt;1976&lt;/DATE&gt;&lt;CHRONPROSE&gt;
                HB was born.&lt;CHRONPROSE&lt;BIRTHPOSITION POSITION=eldest&gt;She was the eldest of
                five daughters.&lt;/DATE&gt;&lt;/CHRONSTRUCT&gt;&lt;/BIRTH&gt;</codeblock>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>Pay attention to the attributes and include where possible, preferably within a
                sentence, though an empty BIRTHPOSITION element with the attribute of eldest is also
                possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>Troubleshooting</u>
            <p><b>Question:</b> If all I know is that she was the eldest of five daughters, how and where
                do I include this in the biography? </p><p> <b>Answer:</b> If possible, construct a sentence
                including this information and place in the <term
                    keyref="chron-prose">CHRONPROSE</term> or following a <term keyref="short-prose">SHORT-PROSE</term>.

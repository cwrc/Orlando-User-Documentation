        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>This element belongs conceptually to <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="writing">WRITING</term></uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="reception">RECEPTION</term></uicontrol>
                </menucascade>. It encloses at least a sentence, or a statement long enough for
                clarity, about negative or harmful consequences of writingâ€”family disapproval, legal
                action, imprisonment, banning of text (see attribute <term keyref="censorship"
                    >CENSORSHIP</term>), etc. It has one optional attribute, CENSORSHIP, with a
                value of <q>CensorshipYes</q>.</p></div>

            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock>&lt;RPENALTIES CENSORSHIP=&quot;CensorshipYes&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Cellier and
                her publisher were both arrested and made to give security for their future good
                behaviour. Copies of her book were burned, and she was sentenced to stand in the
                pillory three times.&lt;/RPENALTIES&gt; &lt;RPENALTIES&gt;Maggie Lisp was thrown out
                of her home when her parents discovered she had been writing
                poetry.&lt;/RPENALTIES&gt;</codeblock>

            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>These penalties should be event-centred and not deal with individual reviews or
                overall movements.</p>

        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>This element belongs conceptually within <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="writing">WRITING</term></uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="production">PRODUCTION</term></uicontrol>
                </menucascade>. Though, it can equally be used within <term
                    keyref="textual-features">TEXTUALFEATURES</term> or <term keyref="reception"
                    >RECEPTION</term>. It is meant to identify named literary or artistic schools
                that influenced an authorâ€™s writing or in which she was a participant or at least
                with which she had significant contact. Make sure to capture the name of the school
                within the tag. Writers/taggers exercise own judgement about whether some aesthetic
                idea or belief constitutes a literary school or not.</p></div>

            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock>Christina Rossetti experienced a tangential relationship with the
                &lt;PLITERARYSCHOOLS&gt;Pre-Raphaelite
                brotherhood.&lt;/PLITERARYSCHOOLS&gt;</codeblock><codeblock> Djuna Barnes&apos;s
                work is considered by many to be a classic example of
                &lt;PLITERARYSCHOOLS&gt;modernism&lt;/PLITERARYSCHOOLS&gt;. </codeblock>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>If the woman writer was affiliated with a political school of thought, that
                information belongs within <term keyref="politics">POLITICS</term> in <term
                    keyref="bibliography">BIBLIOGRAPHY</term>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>Troubleshooting</u>
            <p><b>Question:</b> She was considered a socialist writer. Do I tag that as a literary
                school?</p><p><b>Answer:</b> No, that belongs in a discussion of her political
                affiliation.</p>

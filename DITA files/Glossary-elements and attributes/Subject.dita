        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>I.e. subject of study. This content
                sub-element in <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="">BIOGRAPHY</term></uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="">EDUCATION</term></uicontrol>
                </menucascade>, generally encloses a word or phrase, and records areas of study
                which are significant to a writer's education. It has one attribute, <term keyref=""
                    >Reg</term>, to explain non-standard terms (<codeph>&lt;subject Reg="history‚Äù&gt;kings
                and queens of England&lt;/&gt;</codeph>). We are particularly interested in subjects which
                influenced her writing (for example, she studied archeology and her first novel was
                set at an archeological dig), classical language studies for women writers in the
                early period (recording the importance of ancient languages as a masculine domain,
                and the acquisition of translation skills), and other subjects which were
                non-traditional for women (for example, engineering). Tag reading and writing as
                    <term keyref="">Subjects</term> only during periods when they were remarkable.
                Be selective about <term keyref="">Subjects</term>, depending on breadth of
                curriculum and how much information is available. Fill in the keyref attributes once
                glossentry topics for the specified elements exist (use the id attribute on the
                glossentry element.</p></div>

            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock> VA's father, horrified at her relationship with a young woman, sent her to a
                Domestic Training College at Eastbourne, to learn &lt;subject&gt;Domestic
                Economy&lt;/subject&gt;. Her mother ensured that SA was given a thorough education
                that included &lt;subject&gt;Latin&lt;/subject&gt;, &lt;subject&gt;mathematics&lt;/subject&gt;,
                &lt;subject&gt;philosophy&lt;/subject&gt;, and &lt;subject&gt;political economy&lt;/subject&gt;</codeblock>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>Only subjects which had a significant impact or were central to the person should be tagged. If her major in university was geography, or if she took a course in it which interested her particularly, then tag it; if she studied geography as part of a wide-ranging syllabus in secondary school, probably not.
                Use a separate subject tag for each subject specified. Do not put one tag around a phrase like "she studied history, philosophy, and literature."

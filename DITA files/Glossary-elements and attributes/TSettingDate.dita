        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>This element in <menucascade>

                </menucascade> pertains the time in which a fictional story is set relative to the
                writer's time, not the reader's. It should contain a statement, which may include a
                specific date like <q>1789</q>, or general description, such as <q>in the
                future</q>, or should relate to a recognizable event like <q>after the First World
                    War</q>. N.b. use for works of fiction (including drama and poetry) only, not
                for history, biography, or travel writing. Encloses a statement, incorporating a
                tagged date or a broad definition of period. Has no mandatory or optional
                sub-elements, but one optional attribute, <term keyref="setting-date-type"
                    >SETTINGDATETYPE</term>, with values of <userinput>PAST</userinput>,
                    <userinput>PRESENT</userinput>, <userinput>FUTURE</userinput>, and
                    <userinput>AMBIGUOUS</userinput>. Tag as time present only if contemporaneity is
                in some way relevant, not if itâ€™s merely assumed.</p></div>

            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock>&lt;TSETTINGDATE SETTINGDATETYPE=&quot;FUTURE&quot;&gt;The novel is set post-apocalyptic Israel.&lt;/TSETTINGDATE&gt;</codeblock><codeblock>&lt;TSETTINGDATE SETTINGDATETYPE=&quot;PAST&quot;&gt;This gothic romance, set in the fifteenth-century, features three notable characters.&lt;/TSETTINGDATE&gt;</codeblock>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>We are privileging the author's relationship to the setting date. Therefore, 1984 is
                still a novel set in the future because it was written as such.</p>

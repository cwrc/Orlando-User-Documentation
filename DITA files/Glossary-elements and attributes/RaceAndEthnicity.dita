    <glossdef>
        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>RACEANETHNICITY is a significant
                sub-element within <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="biography">BIOGRAPHY</term></uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="cultural-formation"
                        >CULTURALFORMATION</term></uicontrol>
                </menucascade>. It encloses the structural elements containing the discussion of a
                person's racial and ethnic subject position, capturing information and discussion in
                light of the unstable, historically constituted categories of race and ethnicity. It
                works in conjunction with four content, subject-specific sub-elements: <term
                    keyref="race-colour">RACECOLOUR</term>, <term keyref="national-heritage"
                    >NATIONALHERITAGE</term>, <term keyref="geog-heritage">GEOGHERITAGE</term>,
                    <term keyref="ethnicity">ETHNICITY</term> (each of which can be used without
                RACEANDETHNICITY). You can also access within it all the other sub-elements
                appropriate to the discussion of CULTURALFORMATION: <term keyref="class"
                    >CLASS</term>, <term keyref="denomination">DENOMINATION</term>, <term
                    keyref="gender">GENDER</term>, <term keyref="language">LANGUAGE</term>, <term
                    keyref="nationality">NATIONALITY</term>, <term keyref="political-affiliation"
                    >POLITICALAFFILIATION</term>, and <term keyref="sexual-identity"
                    >SEXUALIDENTITY</term>.</p><p>The following applies to both the general
                discursive discussion of RACEANDETHNICITY and to the specific sub-element
                categories.</p><p>Despite anxiety over the ways in which categories of race or
                ethnicity circulate and serve various kinds of undesirable interests, to ignore the
                question or choose a totally free-text route is not a responsible solution for this
                project, though it would certainly be easier and simpler. The aim here is to make
                the complexities of the question of race and ethnicity emerge, and to make it clear
                that these are shifting, historically constituted, and interestedly deployed
                categories whose use must be understood contextually. The discursiveness with which
                we present these categories should, hopefully, help to do this and also allay the
                anxiety we feel about <q>labelling in a vacuum</q>. In other words, the project has
                no notion that we could or should come up with what is in any way an exact, fully
                defined, or mutually exclusive set of categories: the point is the overlap within
                them. Within this system, counting per se becomes highly problematic; the user has
                to do some work (and some thinking/active defining) before arriving at any kind of
                list or count, and will hopefully arrive at it with a sense of how problematic such
                an activity is. We want, as we go, carefully to build sets of associations around
                terms that are controversial or hard to interpret.</p><p>Despite anxiety over the

                them to be right for the context, tagging with the category or categories within
                which they seem to fit, but they should be encouraged not to let race/ethnicity
                become invisible or only an issue in relation to the marginalized. If we think it
                will look silly if there is a statement in entry after entry on British women
                writers saying that she was (presumably) white, that indicates the force of
                biographical conventions and we should not let them dictate our practices. And we
                should, as stressed by those concerned about <q>white</q> and <q>black</q> as
                homogenizing categories, encourage people to reach for specificity through
                multiplicity: i.e. generally attempt to include at least two of: <term
                    keyref="race-colour">RACECOLOUR</term>; <term keyref="ethnicity"
                    >ETHNCITIY</term>; <term keyref="nationality">NATIONALITY</term>, or <term
                    keyref="national-heritage">NATIONALHERITAGE</term>. We have devised a structured
                vocabulary for these tags, though the lists need not be mutually exclusive or even
                internally consistent. Thus <q>Jewish</q> will be tagged as either RACECOLOUR or
                ETHNICITY (as well as <term keyref="denomination">DENOMINATION</term>
                <term keyref="REG">REG</term>=Judaism) or both; <q>Ukrainian</q> may appear in
                either <term keyref="national-heritage">NATIONALHERITAGE</term> or
                Ethnicity.</p><p>Parallel to the <q>issue</q> tags, this element is important
                because this is such a charged issue, and has remained so through seismic shifts in
                scientific and other concepts of race. This tag can be used to chart developments in
                self-awareness as well as in social placing.</p></div>

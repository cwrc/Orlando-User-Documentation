                </menucascade>. allows us to distinguish intimate relationships that were erotic
                and/or explicitly sexual from intimate relationships that were not, through its
                three potential values: <userinput>eroticYes</userinput>,
                    <userinput>eroticNo</userinput>, and <userinput>eroticPossibly</userinput>.
                EROTIC in this context suggests that sexuality was an issue in the relationship
                whether or not it was acted upon, in either same-sex and opposite-sex relations. In
                not wishing to assume that heterosexual relations between sexual partners are the
                only standard for intimate relationships, we include both erotic and non-erotic
                intimate relationships as central to a woman's life and use this attribute to
                distinguish between the two. This attribute also seeks to redress the historical and
                ideological silence placed upon women's same-sex relationships; it recognizes that
                biographical information concerning these and other relationships often is
                impossible to uncover, and therefore allows for an attribute value of
                    <userinput>eroticPossibly</userinput> that registers the possibility of a sexual
                relationship, when, in the absence of biographical proof, it is impossible to claim
                such as fact.</p><p>If definite information affirms that the relationship was erotic
                (in feeling or in action), select <userinput>eroticYes</userinput>. If your research
                suggests a strong possibly of an erotic attachment but this cannot be confirmed,
                select <userinput>eroticPossibly</userinput>. <userinput>EroticNo</userinput> may be
                used in cases where the entry subject rejected the option of an erotic relationship,
                or when marriage arrangements blatantly disregarded personal preference, as well as
                for e.g. familial intimate association.</p></div>

            <u>Troubleshooting</u>
            <p><b>Question:</b> What if all I know about a woman writer is that she lived with a man
                but don't know whether or not they were sexually involved?</p><p>
                <b>Answer:</b>Use your judgement about an acceptable level of assumption. While we
                do not want to assume that just because people lived together or were married that
                they had an erotic relation, we can reasonably gather from biographical information
                whether sexuality was an issue in the relationship.</p>

            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock>&lt;PADVERTIZING&gt;Jane Smith&apos;s Poems on Several Occasions was

            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>Eighteenth-century prefaces that call themselves advertisements are not to be dealt
                with here. This tag is also not to be used for instances of advertising for other
                books when those ads are printed in the book under discussion.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>Troubleshooting</u>
            <p><b>Question:</b> A bi-plane writes advertising in the sky in <i>Mrs Dalloway</i>. Do I tag it as
                advertising? </p><p><b>Answer:</b> No, do not tag as advertising its appearance as subject-matter,
                but only about the promotional efforts directed to the book as a commodity.</p>

        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>This optional attribute is used to
                modifty the element of <term keyref="t-intertextuality">TINTERTEXTUALITY</term>,
                found in <menucascade>

                </menucascade>. It allows greater specificity to indicate how any earlier text has
                been used in connection with any later text. This attribute, which works in
                conjunction with a sibling attribute, GenderOfAuthor, has eleven values associated
                with it.</p><p>
                <userinput>AllusionAcknowledged</userinput> applies in situations where the author
                explicitly acknowledges her debt to a particular text or set of texts. By contrast,
                if the allusion is clearly evident, but unacknowledged, use
                    <userinput>AllusionUnacknowledged</userinput>.</p><p>
                <userinput>Quotation</userinput> applies when the author lifts words or phrases
                directly from another work (in a prominent position, e.g. a title);
                    <userinput>Misquotation</userinput> is used when she gets it wrong or
                deliberately alters it.</p><p>
                <userinput>Parody</userinput> and <userinput>Satire</userinput> are used when the
                author performs a send-up of another text.</p><p>
                <userinput>Imitation</userinput> or <userinput>Adaptation-update</userinput>
                suggests a favourable reaction to a text previously written.</p><p>
                <userinput>Prequel</userinput> is useful for something like Wide Sargasso Sea which
                attempts to pre-date or speculate about what came before Jane Eyre.</p><p>
                <userinput>Continuation</userinput> (equivalent to sequel, but to someone elseâ€™s
                text) and <userinput>Answer</userinput> signify two separate ways of responding
                imaginatively to a text they differ from <userinput>Imitation</userinput> or
                    <userinput>Adaptation-update</userinput> because they do not directly rely on
                the previous text. <userinput>Answer</userinput> generally means opposition.

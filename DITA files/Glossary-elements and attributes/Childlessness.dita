        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>This sub-element is found within
                expressed, tagg it as <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol><term keyref="biography">BIOGRAPHY</term></uicontrol>

                </menucascade>. It captures the fact that a woman had no children. We hope to
                facilitate research on the material effects of having or not having children on a
                woman writer's life. In order to do so, we must systematize information about women
                who did not have children. This element also allows us to capture discussions of
                significant issues such as infertility that led to life-long childlessness and how
                that affected the writer's life. </p></div>

            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock>&lt;CHILDLESSNESS&gt;MSâ€™s single recorded pregnancy resulted in the birth of
                a stillborn son.&lt;/CHILDLESSNESS&gt; </codeblock><codeblock>
                &lt;CHILDLESSNESS&gt;Their marriage remained
                childless.&lt;/CHILDLESSNESS&gt;</codeblock><codeblock> &lt;CHILDLESSNESS&gt;Their
                decision not to have children seems to have sprung entirely from his preference . .
                . . Her diary somewhat cryptically records quarrels over the issue of having
                children; yet she evidently never insisted.&lt;/CHILDLESSNESS&gt;</codeblock>

            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>If you know that a woman had no children, say so within this element. If she never
                married but you have no proof she never had children, do not lightly assume she was
                childless. Stillborn births, infertility problems and miscarriages can be mentioned
                here but should in any case be mentioned within a <term keyref="health"
                    >HEALTH</term> tag, attribute value <term keyref="female-body"
                >FEMALEBODY</term>. You may mention them in CHILDLESSNESS only if she never had any
                children or if childlessness was a long-term issue for her: using this element
                signifies that a woman was childless all or most of her life or remained without
                surviving offspring. </p>

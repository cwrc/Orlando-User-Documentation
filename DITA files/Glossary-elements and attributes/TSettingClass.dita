        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>tSettingClass is an optional attribute
                attached to the element <uicontrol><term>TSETTINGPLACE</term></uicontrol> (and
                belonging to <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol><term>WRITING</term></uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol><term>TEXTUAL FEATURES</term></uicontrol>
                </menucascade>) that specifies the socio-economic status characters who feature in
                this fictional setting (that is, the scene of a fiction, whether the place is actual
                or imaginary). It recognizes that the setting of a novel about upper-class life may
                differ widely from the setting of a novel centred on struggling workersâ€™ families,
                even though they may overlap topographically. It has one sibling attribute,
                SettingPlaceType, and four allowable values: "upperClass," "workingClass,"
                "middleClass," and "wideRange." The four values allow you to assign an appropriate
                socio-economic status to a settingPlace.</p></div>

                </menucascade>, TTHEMETOPIC is a very flexible tag. It has no controlled vocabulary
                associated with it, but can contain any information. It may enclose much more than a
                single word; may record central themes, side issues in a text, or objects of
                observation or discussion. Place tags, for instance, often appear within TTHEMETOPIC
                tags in accounts of travel literature, and <term keyref="">NAME</term> tags within
                accounts of biography and criticism. (Accounts of place as it operates in fiction
                use a <term keyref="">TSETTINGPLACE</term> tag.) This element applies to both theme
                and topic. Theme is the central idea in a text stated either directly or indirectly;
                topic applies to interesting subjects appearing in a work that might not aspire to
                the status of a "theme". The tag is useful in describing examples of genres such as
                educational or non-fictional texts. It has no mandatory or optional sub-elements or
                attributes.</p></div>

            <p>Theme differs from motif in being less tightly defined, generally informing an
                entire literary work. Topic can be used if a woman wrote a book about cooking, a
                non-fiction work on stitchery, or an educational text which uses the Napoleonic wars
                for its examples. A novel might equally dwell on the topic of cookery or war, or it
                might have military courage or womenâ€™s domestic involvement as a theme.</p>

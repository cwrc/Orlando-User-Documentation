            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock>&lt;SEPARATION&gt;Fanny Kemble signed a formal separation agreement, after disputes over child custody and Butler&apos;s harsh conditions for
support.&lt;/SEPARATION&gt;</codeblock><codeblock>&lt;SEPARATION&gt;ALB separated from her husband in response to her family&apos;s increasing entreaties to consider her own safety, realising
that she was unable to help him, and that her presence worsened his condition. She felt strongly that Rochement&apos;s violence was caused
by illness. In letters to friends, ALB stated that she felt no less affection for her husband, and she was most reluctant and sad
to separate from him.&lt;/SEPARATION&gt;</codeblock>

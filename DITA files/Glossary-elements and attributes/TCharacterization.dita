            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock>&lt;TCHARACTERIZATION&gt;MG cites the psychopathic Bruno as exemplifying the
                way that, as a novelist, she is able to love even her repellent
                characters.&lt;/TCHARACTERIZATION&gt; </codeblock><codeblock>
                &lt;TCHARACTERIZATION&gt;These people in the present day, of varied ethnicity, class
                status, and personal ideology (whose incompatible inner worlds make up the story),
                are all affected in various, unquantifable ways by the now long-past British Empire;
                they live in the shadow of its decline&lt;/TCHARACTERIZATION&gt;

            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>Use for general statements about the fictional characters in a writerâ€™s oeuvre or
                particular work, rather than describing a particular individual. Often used to flag
                the use of actual models in fiction. If you want to write about one particular
                character's role, see <term keyref="t-character-name">TCHARACTERNAME</term>.</p>

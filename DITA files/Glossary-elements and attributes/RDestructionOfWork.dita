                actual destruction, or requests for or threats of destruction whether or not they
                were carried out. It can also be used for incomplete destruction, in which part of a
                work, or a particular copy, was expunged; it encompasses book-burning or requests to
                destroy a manuscript after the authorâ€™s death. This element, which should contain a
                full sentence, has an optional attribute, <term keyref="destroyed-by"
                    >DESTROYEDBY</term>, with values of <userinput>self</userinput> and

            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>If the destruction of the work was also an act of censorship, be sure to also use the
                element <term keyref="penalties">PENALTIES</term> with the attribute for
                censorship.</p>

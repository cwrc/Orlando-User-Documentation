        <div><u>Definition, Placement, Relationships</u><p>This element in <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol><term>WRITING</term></uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol><term>TEXTUALFEATURES</term></uicontrol>
                </menucascade> pertains the time in which a fictional story is set relative to the
                writer's time, not the reader's. It should contain a statement, which may include a
                specific date like "1789," or general description, "in the future," or should relate
                to a recognizable event like "after the First World War." N.b. use for works of
                fiction (including drama and poetry) only, not for history, biography, or travel
                writing. Encloses a statement, incorporating a tagged date or a broad definition of
                period. Has no mandatory or optional sub-elements, but one optional attribute,
                        <uicontrol><term>SETTINGDATETYPE</term></uicontrol>, with values of "past,"
                "present," "future," and "ambiguous." Tag as time present only if contemporaneity is
                in some way relevant, not if itâ€™s merely assumed.</p></div>

            <u>Example</u>
            <codeblock> &amp;lt;tSettingDate SETTINGDATETYPE=&quot;future&quot;&gt;The novel is set
                post-apocalyptic Israel.&amp;lt;/&gt; &amp;lt;tSettingDate
                SETTINGDATETYPE=&quot;past&quot;&gt;This gothic romance, set in the
                fifteenth-century, features three notable characters.&amp;lt;/&gt; </codeblock>
        </div>
        <div>
            <u>Practice Issues</u>
            <p>We are privileging the author's relationship to the setting date. Therefore, 1984 is
                still a novel set in the future because it was written as such.</p>
